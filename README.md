👨‍💻 **MANDAT.io** is an all-in-one mentor-student matchmaking platform.
The mentors (professors) are college students who teach school students.
When a user registers to the platform, they have the option to be either a mentor or a student.
As a student, you have the ability to search for a new mentor based on the following filters:

-   The type of the tutoring session(online or face-to-face)
-   Course subject(maths, physics, etc)
-   Location(only for face-to-face sessions)
-   Rating(of the mentor)

🗺️ Along with the search filters, the student will have their very own integrated map to visually check the location of their soon-to-be mentor.

📷 Both the student and the mentors will have their own profiles. The main attributes of a profile is the rating and the description.
📊 The rating will determined based on the history of each individual on this platform.
Students will give a rating to their mentors and each mentor will have the ability to assign a rating to their students, so please behave yourselves! 🚨

The student will make a request to be added to the mentor's tutoring list.
The mentor will then have the ability to accept or reject the student.

📅 Once the mentor accepts the student's request, he/she will send his/her schedule to the student.
🚫 The student will not be allowed to reserve a timeslot for the session with less than two days in advance.

The tutoring sessions can be _online_ 📺 or _face-to-face_ 👬.

After both parties have agreed to go further with the process.👍
Weekly the mentor will update his/her schedule, his/her students will then have the ability to choose a timeslot in which they want to have their tutoring hours.

🔁 There will also be the ability to set a recurring timeslot, for the students who want to have the same timeslot weekly.

✅ The platform will allow clients to register both with an in-house login system, or to login via Google or Facebook, if they choose so.

📶 If the tutoring hours will be placed under online meetings, then the mentor will have the option to generate a random Zoom or Google Meet link directly from the platform.
