👨‍💻 **MANDAT.io** is an all-in-one mentor-student matchmaking platform.
The mentors (professors) are college students who teach school students.
When a user registers to the platform, they have the option to be either a mentor or a student.
As a student, you have the ability to search for a new mentor based on the following filters:

-   The type of the tutoring session(online or face-to-face)
-   Course subject(maths, physics, etc)
-   Location(only for face-to-face sessions)
-   Rating(of the mentor)

🗺️ Along with the search filters, the student will have their very own integrated map to visually check the location of their soon-to-be mentor.

📷 Both the student and the mentors will have their own profiles. The main attributes of a profile is the rating and the description.
📊 The rating will determined based on the history of each individual on this platform.
Students will give a rating to their mentors and each mentor will have the ability to assign a rating to their students, so please behave yourselves! 🚨

The student will make a request to be added to the mentor's tutoring list.
The mentor will then have the ability to accept or reject the student.

📅 Once the mentor accepts the student's request, he/she will send his/her schedule to the student.
🚫 The student will not be allowed to reserve a timeslot for the session with less than two days in advance.

The tutoring sessions can be _online_ 📺 or _face-to-face_ 👬.

After both parties have agreed to go further with the process.👍
Weekly the mentor will update his/her schedule, his/her students will then have the ability to choose a timeslot in which they want to have their tutoring hours.

🔁 There will also be the ability to set a recurring timeslot, for the students who want to have the same timeslot weekly.

✅ The platform will allow clients to register both with an in-house login system, or to login via Google or Facebook, if they choose so.

📶 If the tutoring hours will be placed under online meetings, then the mentor will have the option to generate a random Zoom or Google Meet link directly from the platform.

# Software Architecture


### MVC 

The term MVC stands for "Model-View-Controller", a UI pattern that breaks up the responsibilities of responding to user requests into several parts.
Our application template is composed of ConsoleApp, WebApp and WebApplication. The WebApp it is structured on a "N-Layer" architecturen.

### Traditional "N-Layer" architecture applications
The application is divided into 4 layers: Business Logic, DataAccess, Common and Entities.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96074975/213930875-b14eff6a-59e4-437c-a96e-49804b8afb19.png)


### Repository Pattern

A Repository is used to manage aggregate persistence and retrieval. The repository mediates between the data-access layer and the domain. It decouples the domain layer from the data layer effectively. It does so by providing collection-like access to the underlying data. The repository offers a collection interface by providing methods to add, modify, remove, and fetch domain objects. This enables the domain to remain agnostic of the underlying persistence mechanism. This allows both these layers to evolve independently maintaining high cohesion with low coupling.

### Unit of Work

The unit of work pattern keeps track of all changes to aggregates. Once all updates of the aggregates in a scope are completed, the tracked changes are played onto the database in a transaction so that the database reflects the desired changes. Thus, the unit of work pattern tracks a business transaction and translates it into a database transaction, wherein steps are collectively run as a single unit. To ensure that data integrity is not compromised, the transaction commits or is rolled back discretely, thus preventing indeterminate state.

# Sustainability and Ethics

### What is sustainability? 

Sustainability is the quality of an activity or a product, that balances, preserves, and improves in the following three dimensions: <b> Social, Economic, Environment. </b>

In order for a product to be sustainable, it should generally be economically viable, preserve or improving existing social structures, and minimizing the environmental footprint.

### Is it MANDAT.io 🚀 sustainable?

###  Social :heavy_check_mark:

The platform promotes education and offers students the chance for cheap and quality education, guided by mentors trained in the field of interest. Mentors have        the chance to round off their income through an easy and fun way related to the studies they are following.

###  Environment :heavy_check_mark:

The platform has a positive impact because through the online meeting option, the need to use means of transport is reduced.

###  Economic :heavy_check_mark:

Future Implementation: In order to post an announcement, mentors must pay a fee. Students can search for announcement for free. Currently this is not implemented,      because the platform is in the testing period on the wide market.
